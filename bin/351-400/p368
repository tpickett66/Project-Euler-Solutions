# The  harmonic series  1

#     +12

#     +

#     13

#     +

#     14

#     + ... is well known to be divergent. 

# 

# If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.

# This modified harmonic series is called the Kempner series.

# 

# 

# Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.

# One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.

# These 20 omitted terms are:

# 1111

# 1222

# 1333

# 1444
