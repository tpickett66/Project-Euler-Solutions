# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91  99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# approach
# I've extended Numeric to include a #palindrome? method that does the check
# for us. Once that was done it's trivial to collect all of the large
# palindromes that are products of two 3 digit numbers in a set.
