# Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

# 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

# It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70  22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

# Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference is pentagonal and D = |Pk Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?
