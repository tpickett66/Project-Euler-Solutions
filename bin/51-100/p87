# The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

# 28 = 22 + 23 + 24

# 33 = 32 + 23 + 24

# 49 = 52 + 23 + 24

# 47 = 22 + 33 + 24

# How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?
